Project-Based Approach: Build small projects and components to solidify my understanding.
Documentation: Document my learning process, challenges, and solutions.
Portfolio: Create a portfolio of projects that showcase my skills and progress.

🛠️ Technologies Used

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing data.
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
React: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.

🎯 Goals

Short-Term: Become proficient in building full-stack applications with the MERN stack.
Long-Term: Secure a position as a Full Stack Developer, leveraging the skills and projects developed through this learning journey.

💼 About Me

I am passionate about web development and eager to learn and grow in the field. My dedication to daily learning and project-based approach reflects my commitment to becoming a skilled Full Stack Developer. Before diving into web development, I was an Android developer, where I honed my skills in mobile app development. This background has provided me with a solid foundation in programming, problem-solving, and user-centric design.
Transitioning from Android development to the MERN stack has allowed me to expand my expertise and tackle new challenges in the realm of web development.
